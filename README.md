# Updating-DB-from-uploaded-excel
Updating the database of the CallManagement Winforms app using an Excel sheet.
I have uploaded two excel sheets, one for insert and one for upload. 
Run the app, toggle insert or update, upload the relevant excel file and voila!

Note.
Excel sheet column names, must match the db's table names exactly.
